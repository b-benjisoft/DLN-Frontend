## Inspiration
Many people have limited access to the internet due to their rural location, lack of infrastructure, financial constraints, and even governmental censorship.
Dataless Network was founded to provide an alternative; by utilising SMS - a network usually far more available both geographically and financially than 3G/4G, internet traffic can be requested and return all via standard text messages.
In the first world, many people find their mobile data runs short very quickly, creating inconvenient and potentially even dangerous circumstances in which they lack access to the internet. We did some basic market research, questioning students in the Reading area about how much of their SMS and mobile data contracts they used. The response was overwhelmingly that they went over their allowance of mobile data however barely used any of their SMS allowances. After further questioning, it seems that people have replaced their texting with social networking apps like Snapchat and Instagram.
This was what motivated us to explore the concept.

## What it does
DLN uses SMS to send information from the internet for a very low cost. 

## How we built it
We used Lambda in order to simplify the infrastructure as well as Nexmo for sending and receiving messages. For the information, we linked into a multitude of APIs. Including the Oxford English Dictionary, Google Translate and Wikipedia. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had an issue with one of the companies claiming that we didn't pay them even though we were charged. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working Lambda backend
Working Nexmo messages
Learning javascript on the fly (With the exception of Ben)

## What we learned
Companies do not always play ball and that can delay things, by a lot!

## What's next for Dataless Network
We are looking to expand to as many APIs as possible as well as monetizing the platform for sustainability.
